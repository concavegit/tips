# tips
My value as a software engineer comes from my ability to find the right tool, debug issues, design systems, and plan projects. These topics may seem generic, but there are specific procedures that are responsible for my edge in those areas that I have learned from experience. This repository contains a [wiki](https://github.com/concavegit/tips/wiki) with tips to help others do software engineering at least as well as I can.

Feel free to create an Issue for suggestions on how I can improve my tips.
